## üîß Environment Variables

This project doesn't require any environment variables. Everything runs client-side!

---

## üåê Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add a Custom Domain

1. In your Netlify site dashboard, go to **Domain settings**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**

### Example DNS Settings:

For `www.yourdomain.com`:
```
CNAME  www  your-site-name.netlify.app
```

For apex domain `yourdomain.com`:

## üìä Deployment Status

After deployment, you'll get:
- **Live URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Deploy previews** for pull requests
- **Automatic deployments** when you push to GitHub
- **Free SSL certificate** (HTTPS enabled)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

**Problem**: Build fails with error

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Test build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors

### 404 Errors on Refresh

**Problem**: Page not found when refreshing on non-root routes

**Solution**: The `netlify.toml` redirect rule should fix this. If not, add `_redirects` file:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Site Looks Different Than Local

**Problem**: Styling issues or missing features

**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify all assets are in the `build` folder

### Large Build Size Warning

**Problem**: Build size exceeds recommendations

**Solution**: This is normal for React apps with PDF generation libraries. Netlify supports builds up to 200MB.

<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
